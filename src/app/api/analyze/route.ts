**DOCUMENT TO ANALYZE:**
File: ${file.name}
Location Context: ${location || 'General market analysis'}

**DOCUMENT CONTENT:**
${text}

**COMPREHENSIVE CONSUMER CHAMPION FORENSIC ANALYSIS:**

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE FINAL VERDICT**
Rate this quote: FAIR / QUESTIONABLE / CONCERNING / PREDATORY
Provide clear recommendation: PROCEED / PROCEED WITH CAUTION / WALK AWAY

**CRITICAL RED FLAGS IDENTIFIED**
Examine the entire document for:
- High-pressure language or urgency tactics ("limited time", "today only", "immediate danger")
- Vague terms that hide costs ("as needed", "up to", "may require", "subject to")
- Overpriced services compared to market rates
- Missing standard consumer protections
- Concerning contract terms or warranty limitations

**FORENSIC COST ANALYSIS & MARKET COMPARISON**
Analyze all pricing with microscopic detail:
- Extract and evaluate EVERY dollar amount mentioned
- Break down costs: labor, materials, permits, markup
- Compare to industry benchmarks (HVAC: $3,000-$8,000 typical range)
- Identify potential overcharges with specific dollar amounts
- Flag hidden fees or unclear pricing structures
- Calculate cost per unit/ton/square foot where applicable

**TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT ASSESSMENT**
Scrutinize all equipment and services:
- Identify specific brands, models, and technical specifications mentioned
- Extract efficiency ratings (SEER, HSPF, tonnage) if provided
- Analyze warranty terms for each component
- Flag proprietary or uncommon equipment that limits consumer choice
- Note missing technical specifications that should be provided
- Assess appropriateness of proposed solutions

**CONTRACT TERMS & CONSUMER RIGHTS REVIEW**
Examine legal language and protections:
- Review cancellation policies and associated fees
- Analyze warranty coverage and limitations
- Identify terms that favor the business unfairly
- Flag any arbitration clauses or dispute resolution terms
- Note missing standard consumer protections
- Extract problematic contract language verbatim

**SCAM DETECTION & EXPLOITATION PATTERNS**
Look for common predatory practices:
- Bundled services without proper itemization
- Unusual financing terms or payment structures
- Claims about "immediate danger" or "emergency repairs"
- Pressure tactics around decision timing
- Vague or proprietary technology claims
- Missing licensing, insurance, or bonding information

**CONSUMER ACTION PLAN & BATTLE STRATEGY**
Provide specific, actionable guidance:
- Exact questions to ask the contractor
- Specific terms to demand be changed or clarified
- Dollar amounts to negotiate (be specific with targets)
- Red flags that warrant immediate termination of discussions
- Steps to protect consumer interests
- Alternative options consumers should consider

**MARKET INTELLIGENCE & NEGOTIATION LEVERAGE**
Based on the analysis:
- What should this service actually cost in this market?
- Which elements are overpriced and by how much?
- What are the strongest negotiation points?
- When should the consumer walk away entirely?

**FINAL CONSUMER CHAMPION PROCLAMATION**
Deliver uncompromising guidance on whether consumers should proceed, what they must demand if they do, or why they should walk away. Be specific about risks and mitigation strategies.

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
- Quote exact problematic language when found
- Provide specific dollar amounts for all cost concerns
- Name specific equipment brands/models mentioned
- Calculate percentage markups above market rates
- Be absolutely uncompromising in protecting consumer interests
- Format with clear headers and bullet points for readability

**APPROACH:** Conduct this as a forensic audit to protect a family member from exploitation. Miss nothing. Question everything. Be thorough but concise.`;
